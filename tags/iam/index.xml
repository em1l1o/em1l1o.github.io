      <description>Background One day I found that we&amp;rsquo;ve lost days of monitoring data of some instances, so I logged into one of these instances and run the CloudWatch monitoring script manually to send some data to AWS. However, I got this message from AWS:
The security token included in the request is expired
 Security credentials are required in order to use services and resources of AWS, and it is very convenient to manage these credentials via IAM roles, which is the way we&amp;rsquo;ve always done it.</description>
