      <description>Background I found that our production instances memory utilization exceeded the threshold frequently in the past few weeks. This was what it looked like:
In the past one month (even longer), there&amp;rsquo;s an incremental memory consumption in our application. And one day, it exceeded the line.
Actually, the same had been happening to our test instance for a long time, due to many cron jobs that won&amp;rsquo;t exit as expected. As time goes by, more and more memory was consumed by them.</description>
