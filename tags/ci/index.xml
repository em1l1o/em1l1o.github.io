      <description>Background Due to the lack of CI, I have to run RSpec manually every time I am about to merge my feature branch into master branch. It&amp;rsquo;s an exhausting and forgettable yet important chore. People are unreliable, however, it is just a matter of time before something goes wrong. That&amp;rsquo;s why I decided to build our CI pipeline to run RSpec.
CI Options I have CircleCI and Jenkins under consideration. However, we have to pay to use CircleCI.</description>
